Introduction to Qualitative Games
=================================


The CHERMUG qualitative game aims to support students as they learn about the qualitative approach to research methods. The qualitative approach is suitable as an exploratory approach for investigating a phenomenon when not much is known about that phenomenon or to provide a broad understanding of a complex problem. The qualitative approach seeks to generate new knowledge and new ideas, rather than testing existing knowledge or ideas. The qualitative approach to research is increasingly recognized as providing valuable detailed information that the quantitative approach cannot. In the CHERMUG qualitative game the phenomenon under investigation is the obesity epidemic. Qualitative research would be appropriate for exploring the obesity epidemic for example in understanding why people eat the foods they do, how they feel about their bodies and constraints they might experience in losing weight. 

There are many issues which need to be considered when carrying out qualitative research and the qualitative game focuses on just a few of these. The qualitative game aims  
•	To consolidate students’ understanding of the main characteristics of the qualitative approach and differences between the qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
•	To allow students to practice designing a qualitative study 
•	To allow students to practice qualitative coding using realistic examples

Game levels 
-----------

The game is structured into three levels of difficulty which correspond to the 3 stages of the narrative. Level 1 is the introductory level where students develop and demonstrate their understanding of key differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches to research. Levels 2 and 3 focus on specific research studies. Players are presented with a specific research question and an account of the background to a study and they are required to carry out exercises in which they have to select an appropriate data collection method and suitable sample of participants to take part in the proposed study. They are also required to carry out some simple qualitative coding. At level 2 players are given supportive feedback about their selections and coding as they proceed through the activities. At level 3 students are encouraged to adopt a more exploratory approach and they only receive feedback at the end of the game when they have taken part in all the activities.
