Introduction to Qualitative Games
=================================


The **CHERMUG qualitative games** aims to support students as they learn about the qualitative approach to research methods. The qualitative approach is suitable as an exploratory approach for investigating a phenomenon when not much is known about that phenomenon or to provide a broad understanding of a complex problem. The _qualitative approach_ seeks to generate **new knowledge** and **new ideas**, _rather than testing existing_ knowledge or ideas. The qualitative approach to research is increasingly recognized as providing valuable detailed information that the quantitative approach cannot. In the CHERMUG qualitative game the phenomenon under investigation is the obesity epidemic. Qualitative research would be appropriate for exploring the obesity epidemic for example in understanding why people eat the foods they do, how they feel about their bodies and constraints they might experience in losing weight. 

There are many issues which need to be considered when carrying out qualitative research and the qualitative game focuses on just a few of these. The qualitative game aims  
*	To consolidate studentsâ€™ understanding of the _main characteristics of the qualitative approach_ and _differences_ between the qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
*	To allow students to _practice designing a qualitative study_. 
*	To allow students to _practice qualitative coding_ using realistic examples.

Game levels 
-----------

The game is structured into three levels of difficulty which correspond to the 3 stages of the narrative. Level 1 is the introductory level where students develop and demonstrate their understanding of key differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches to research. Levels 2 and 3 focus on specific research studies. Players are presented with a specific research question and an account of the background to a study and they are required to carry out exercises in which they have to select an appropriate data collection method and suitable sample of participants to take part in the proposed study. They are also required to carry out some simple qualitative coding. At level 2 players are given supportive feedback about their selections and coding as they proceed through the activities. At level 3 students are encouraged to adopt a more exploratory approach and they only receive feedback at the end of the game when they have taken part in all the activities.

Download Qualitative Games
--------------------------

The qualitative games present two different delivery versions:

*	**Standalone**: games as Java jar package ready to download and run in your machine. The only requirements is to have Java 6 version (or higher) installed on your machine. The stand alone version will run in MAC, Windows and Unix platforms. 
*	**SCORM version**: games as SCORM 2004 4th Edition packages ready to be included in SCORM compliant Learning Management Systems (such us Moodle 2.x).

Besides, games are available in the following languages:
* English
* Spanish
* Dutch
* Romanian
* Finnish
